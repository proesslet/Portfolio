    <h1>Generational AI</h1>
    <p>
      The past several years have brought about a lot of advancements in the
      world of technology. We have gone from computers taking up entire rooms to
      computers that fit in our pockets. We saw the invention of the first smart
      phone and now we can carry the whole world on our wrists. We've also seen
      the creation of the cloud - this mystical place where we can store all of
      our data and access it from anywhere. We've seen the rise of social media
      and the fall of privacy. However, one of the most shocking advancements is
      the rise of artificial intelligence.

    <br />
    <p>
      We've seen AI go from being a science fiction concept to a reality. With
      this, we have seen new issues and questions about our world. Every single
      person now has access to generative AI that can create images, videos, and
      even text. While this is a huge advancement, it is also scary to think
      about the fact that we don't know what our future holds.

      However, that is not really my focus. Instead, I am going to discuss the
      idea of generational AI. Many generations have come and gone as technology
      has advanced, and each generation has its own uses for technology -
      specifically AI. I am particularly focused in how the younger generations
      are using AI and how future generations might look if some of the trends
      we have seen continue. Some people argue that AI might take away our
      skills of critical thinking and creativity. There are others that argue
      that it is a great tool to help further our thinking. However, we need to
      determine where we should draw that line. Then there is also the concern
      within the academic world that AI might make current teaching methods
      irrelevant.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm also going to discuss to what extent younger generations use AI, such
      as Chat-GPT, compared to older generations. Currently it seems as if
      younger generations tend to treat AI as some sort of all-knowing servant
      that can do anything with 100% accuracy. (If you've spent anytime using
      Chat-GPT, you know that is not the case.) I'd like to provide info to
      these younger generations that might help future generations use AI
      responsibly by pointing out some of the flaws that older generations might
      have already figured out.
