# About this Project

This project is a portfolio of myself as a developer. Not only does it show of some of my skills with web development, but it also give me a space to share some of the projects I have worked on and connect with other developers.

# What is it built with?

- Vue.JS
- Custom CSS

It is currently being hosted on Netlify, but I plan to eventually build out a backend so I will need to find a new hosting solution that doesn't break the bank. Currently I am looking at using Heroku.

# Where will it go from here?
I plan to add on to this website as I learn more and more about computer science. I will of course update my list of projects that I've worked on, but I also plan to add some of the following features:
- Blog
- Admin page for myself to update content directly from the website
- Coding tutorials
